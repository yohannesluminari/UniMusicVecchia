      Hi, I'm Yohannes Luminari, an italian <span class="current-role cobalt-gradient">{{ currentRole }}</span>.
      I want to introduce you to my first major website, which is centered around a cornerstone of my life, as it is for many others: Music.

      UniMusic is a platform created to bring people together. It was developed in under a month to meet external needs, so if you notice any
      issues or bugs, or if you have suggestions for improvements, please don't hesitate to contact me. I would greatly appreciate your feedback.
      Not only do I enjoy working on this project, but it's also a valuable learning experience for me.

    </p>

    <p class="introduction unimusic">

      <span class="animated-artists">+{{ animatedArtists }}</span> artists and more than
      <span class="animated-tracks">+{{ animatedTracks }}</span> tracks.
      In case your favorite artists or anyone you like isn't listed, feel free to contact me, and I'll add them.
